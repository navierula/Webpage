<b><p>Preface</b></p>

<p>There are a number of topics that I am interested in. For that reason, I have chosen to take on independent research regarding areas I might possibly want to pursue. All work displayed on are of my own initiative.<p>

<p><u>Motivation/Abstract:</u></p>

<p>The Pew Research Center&#39;s &quot;Social Networking Fact Sheet&quot; indicates that 74% of adults engage with social media. As of September 2014: 71% use Facebook, 28% use Pinterest and LinkedIn, 26% use Instagram, and 23% use Twitter. With more access to web-application technology given our world’s fast-advancing digital infrastructure, these number are only projected to grow; thereby, increasing the amount of conversations that already place over the Internet medium. Popular opinion continues to be made public; thereby, encouraging institutions to mine social networking data in order to illustrate “this” week’s trend in a light that will appeal to the majority. Hao Wang and his team of researchers at the University of Southern California, for instance, developed a statistical classifier featuring a naive Bayes model in order to analyze text regarding the 2012 U.S. presidential election cycle. Their system received tweets continuously, tracking subjectivity as it pertains to each running candidate. This process is called opinion mining, or sentiment analysis. Meena Rambocas and Joao Gama, researchers in the field of economic-management at the University of West Indies (Trinidad and Tobago) and the University of Porto (Portugal), have even alluded to large corporations adopting this technique and specifically announced sentiment analysis as a useful tool to examine triangulation challenges taking place in online platforms.</p>

<p>As a millennial citizen dependent on communication via technology, I have developed my own sentiment analysis model as well. Its blueprint is generalized enough so that it may used to classify any text; though, I have chosen to focus on popular hashtags trending via Twitter. I have discovered that my system classifies accurately, despite the numerical deviation from calculating what I term the &quot;sentiment score&quot; when pitting one model (i.e. &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot;) against a dataset containing similar tweets. Improvements are to be made in regards to this aspect; however, it still suffices to say that the model, keeping in mind its purpose, succeeds.</p>

<p><u>Motivation/Abstract:</u></p>

<p>Stephen Rachman, the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies in the Department of English at Michigan State University, makes note of the fact that Edgar Allan Poe's &quot;Al-Aaraaf&quot; (1829) sits like a bookend near the beginning, or perhaps the end, of his career. The same can be said for &quot;Israfel&quot; (1831), another poem written shortly after &quot;Al-Aaraaf.&quot; It has also not been read as much as &quot;Annabel Lee,&quot; &quot;The Bells,&quot; or &quot;The Raven.&quot; Though both these early 19th century have not been eyed critically by literary aficionados, this does not mean that these poems should fall into the category of &quot;nevermore.&quot; The fact of the matter is plain and simple: Poe wrote all his works with meaning and intent.</p>

<p>In my piece, I offer an article-length analysis of &quot;Al-Aaraaf&quot; and &quot;Israfel.&quot; I will also speak to Poe's insistence on incorporating non-traditional elements within his writing in efforts to further emphasize that truths regarding death, life, or the in-between can be found in places deemed unusual.</p>
