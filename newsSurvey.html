            In December 2017, I released a <a href="papers/narula_newsheadlines.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> on linguistic differences between real and fake news headlines. As part of the report, I conducted a survey asking participants to examine a random subset of headlines from 135 instances in my dataset. The results from the survey can be found in the report, but if you'd like to follow my process for how I chose to design the survey, please read on!</p>

            <b><u>Survey Medium</u></b><p>
<p align="justify">
            Participants don't necessarily <i>want</i> to take surveys, especially if they are not being compensated. For this reason, I wanted to use a platform that would deliver the most simple survey-taking experience while also allowing for simple aesthetics and a reliable interface. <a href="https://www.google.com/forms/about/" target="_blank"> Google Forms</a> seemed to be the most appropriate choice for my particular experiment. </p>
<p align="justify">
  Its ability to easily be linked to other social media platforms such as Twitter or Facebook was especially appealing, since my target audience were active users of social media as it is becoming the #1 source for news consumption. </p>

  <b><u>Survey Content</u></b><p>
  The maximum amount of time I wanted people to spend on my survey was 2 minutes (with intention).
